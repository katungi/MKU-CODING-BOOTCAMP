    <!-- a form takes in input tags that prompt the user to enter data. 
        - input forms have attributes. like type, name, id and class
        - the type attribute is what determines what type of input the form will take.
        - some have special attributes like value= "" for specifying the visible name of the attibute
        - We also introduced the label tag that is used to show text as well
